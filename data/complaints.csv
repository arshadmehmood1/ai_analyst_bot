Complaint: I am a rider at the G3 branch of Cheezious. On the 26th of August, I had an emergency and had to take a 2-day leave, which I informed Mr. Salman, my delivery manager, about and also submitted my leave application to him. On the 3rd of September, Mr. Salman, Mr. Arif, and a few other managers called me into the office and questioned why I took off on the 26th. I explained that I had a family emergency and had already informed Mr. Salman. They then questioned me about my shoes, saying they were not appropriate, and I replied that I would buy new ones soon. Afterward, they said I did not have a new version phone, so I could not work there, to which I responded that I couldn't afford a new phone right now but would try to get a better one. Then, Mr. Usama, the delivery head, came into the office and started insulting me in front of everyone, asking who I was to tell them that orders were delayed from the kitchen and not from my side. He misbehaved with me, and I told him that I was leaving the job, so he should not talk to me like that. Additionally, Mr. Salman and Mr. Anas often take drugs and vape during their duty hours, even on the floor and also use mobile phone throughout the duty. On the 26th of August, Mr. Anas was caught taking drugs outside the branch during duty hours, and a police mobile took him to the station. After 2-3 hours, the branch RM and ARL brought him back after negotiating with the police. This is happening in front of the Cheezious Lahore Head Office, yet no one seems to notice. Mr. Usama's and Mr. Salman's behavior is worsening day by day, and they do not deserve to hold their positions.

This is an urgent issue. Mr. Zark is threatening me with termination and has been behaving very rudely.

I requested my Manager (Mr. Ali) and RM (Mr. Noman) to allow me to repay the loan in two installments—10k in September and 10k in October—and they agreed.

My complaint is that I am kept on duty even after my shift ends. When there is work, I get overtime, but when there isn’t, I am still made to stay. One day, after my shift ended, Supervisor Mr. Hamid made me stay even though there were already 25 riders waiting. I told him that my shift was over and showed a video proving all 25 riders were present. Despite this, Manager Mr. Usama threatened me, saying he would have me jailed, punished, or terminated. He pressured me to write a resignation letter stating I would leave on September 25. Out of fear, I wrote the resignation letter, but I don’t want to quit.

I want to report that my mobile phone was stolen from the branch about four months ago. I was working as a salesman, and it was my second day on the job. I didn’t know that phones needed to be submitted at the mobile counter, so I left my phone in a box in the salesroom and continued working. After 3-4 hours, when I checked, my phone was missing. I asked the other staff, and they said it might be at the counter. When I went to the counter, the cashier, Umar Din, told me that the manager, Mr. Mubeen Javed, had taken the phone. I asked Mr. Mubeen for my phone at the end of my shift, but he said he didn’t have it. I told him it was there, but he insisted he didn’t have it. He asked the staff verbally, but no one knew where it was, and the matter was closed. The next day, I asked Mr. Mubeen again, and he said he had checked the CCTV footage but found nothing. I kept asking daily, but I never got a satisfactory answer. They said they were tracing the phone, but nothing happened. I reported the issue to management, and they said Mr. Mubeen was in charge of handling it. When I approached Mr. Mubeen, he threatened to fire me if I continued asking about my phone.
Now, Mr. Mubeen has been transferred to another branch a month ago, kindly investigate the whole matter, I am very disheart my phone is still missing.

I want to  complaint about cultural violations occurring in our branch. Favoritism is negatively impacting our work culture. Two staff members, Adeena and Samia, are receiving excessive favoritism from our Branch Leader, Mr. Awab. We face a much workload while they have significantly less and more free time. Additionally, Mr. Awab often sits with them, sharing biryani, and makes sure they aren't overloaded with tasks. As a result, they frequently tease us and behave disrespectfully.
I brought this to the attention of our BC and OM, Mr. Haris and Mr. Suleman, but they dismissed my concerns, claiming it’s just normal human attraction and that I should ignore it. No action has been taken regarding this favoritism.
Yesterday, my shift ended at 6 PM, but after my shift manager left, Mr. Awab kept me until 9 PM for a meeting. He clearly stated that if I had any issues, ""you wouldn’t be allowed back at this branch and would be transferred instead.""

I joined Bread and Beyond on April 21, 2023. I spent 8 months at DD and 8 months at H Block. However, after a supervisor resigned at DD, I was called back to DD due to the lack of manpower. There were frequent issues at DD, such as a shortage of salesmen, so I used to email HR. However, Mr. Zeeshan Haider, the Operations Head at DD, stopped me and told me that I had no right to email HR without asking them first. He said I shouldn't contact the HR department without their permission. Mr. Zeeshan often uses abusive language towards me and even insults me in front of Mr. Ali Kazmi, who tries to intervene, but Mr. Zeeshan doesn't care.Recently, I was in a rush and forgot to turn off the wall fan and lights.

I would like to raise a complaint regarding my salary for this month, which does not include any bonuses. According to our policy, an employee is entitled to a bonus of 1,000 for not having any suspensions in a month and an additional 1,000 for not taking any leave or being late.
